=head1 NAME

smt-manager.pl - View current status of CPU topology or set logical cores to
                offline or online.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

smt-manager.pl [options]

  --help        Prints this help.
  --online      Enables all logical CPU cores.
  --offline     Disables all logical CPU cores.
  --manual      Display man page of this script.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help>

Prints standard help information and options that are available.

=item B<--online>

Attempts to enable all logical cores if they are already offline.  If they are
not offline, no changes will be made and no secondary topology print out will
occur.

=item B<--offline>

Performs the opposite action as --online.

=item B<--manual>

Displays help page as a man page and also displays description and summary.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script provides the user details about whether each CPU is physical or
logical.  When provided an optional parameter, the logical CPUs can be enabled
or disabled.

Why would one want to disable logical cores?  Logical CPU cores with a high nice
value steal more CPU time than a physical core.  This is noticeable when
multitasking heavily, for instance, building a kernel with 8 cores as a very
nice (+20) task while running a greedy single threaded application.

By disabling the logical cores, the behavior and responsiveness of the system
will be more predictable, but throughput will drop as a whole for heavy multi-
threaded batch jobs.
